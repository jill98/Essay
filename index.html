<p>I, Jill Marney, have developed this website specifically to tell any up-and-coming Liberal Arts students at Virginia Tech how hard it is to develop websites. Just know that I suffered out of love.</p> 
                    <p>As a freshman myself, I feel as though it is important to share the new model for Virginia Tech's Liberal Arts program with any rising first-years entering this field of study. Especially since the VT model emphasizes the use of technology in Liberal Arts, which can be an unappealing area at times for those who prefer more abstract and interpretative studies. I have only been coding for a couple weeks, and, as someone who leans more towards Liberal Arts, I can that intersecting with technology is a grueling challenge, but always a rewarding one. </p>
                    <p>Before taking the course Writing and Digital Media, I only taught myself the bare minimum of computer applications to skate by. I managed well in Microsoft Programs and Google Docs, but any deeper terrified me. Besides, I was more of a creative learner, drawn to reading, writing, and drawing; there didn't seem to be any point trying to learn the confusing and detailed art of coding, right? <i>Wrong.</i> I did not realize how much I could thrive creatively with even just a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. And although most days I want to slam my head against my Lenovo if I can't figure something out, nothing in the world beats clicking on your website link and having all your meticulous, grueling hardwork, and <i>not</i> having a <b>404 Page Not Found</b> pop up instead.</p>
                    <p>Coding is inherently intuitive and easy to commit to memory. To those who aren't initiually passionate about technological expertise, or to those who aren't detail-oriented, it will be a frustrating and draining process at the start. But success in an area that doesn't come naturally to you will taste so much sweeter than success in areas that you are already proficient. I struggle with website design still, but now I'm not just "managing". I'm thriving. </p>
                    
                     <p>The vertical component represents the focus on departmental and disciplinary strengths within specified subjects to deepen understanding. Virginia Tech promotes these ideals through intensive curricula in all areas of study. The enhanced T then allows the spread of technological education to all departments, from engineering to liberal arts.</p>
                     
                     <h3>Enhanced T</h3>
                    <p>Before taking the course Writing and Digital Media, I only taught myself the bare minimum of computer applications to skate by. Since the terms <i>patience</i> and <i>attention to details</i> didn't exist in my vocabulary, there didn't seem to be any point trying to learn the confusing art of coding, so I thought <i>Why bother?</i> What I had yet to realize, though, was how much I could thrive as a student with even just a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Coding is inherently intuitive and easy to commit to memory. To those who aren't initiually passionate about technological expertise, or to those who aren't detail-oriented, it will be a frustrating and draining process at the start. Here are some sources (with links!) that can help with the process:
                       <ul class="feature-icons">
                           <li class="fa-icons"><a href="https://www.lynda.com/"><b>Lynda.com:</b></a> <i>Tutorial videos for all website design aspect (HTML, CSS, Markdown, Java, etc.)</i></li>
                           <li class="fa-icons"><a href="https://github.com/"><b>GitHub.com:</b></a> <i>Website platform for easy projects with HTML, CSS, and Markdown.</i></li>
                           <li class="fa-icons"><a href="http://commonmark.org/help/"><b>Commonmark.org:</b></a> <i>Concise and informative practice platform and tutorial for Markdown.</i></li>

                        <p>The goal of this website will be to create a concise aid of all the information these sites share. I want to create a practice platform and a simple explanation of HTML, CSS, and Markdown for students who wish to start coding who aren't naturally drawn to the area of study.</p>
