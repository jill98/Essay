    <title>Essay Concerning My Design and Concept</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My idea for my website is to create an informative and interactive experience that will promote the Enhanced T lifestyle to Liberal Arts students and help teach a condensed cheatsheet for HTML, CSS, and Markdown, along with a practice platform. I was inspired by that quick website that taught Markdown, since I picked up Markdown remarkably quick because of it. My goal, as someone who was so lost at the start of learning these concepts, is to aid those who feel the same, and hopefully changing their opinion on the subject. My intention for my design is to be very attractive and simplistic, and the tone of the content very genuine and personal, especially since the content (website design) is not always the easiest subject to pick up. From what I gathered from Spool's article, planning my intentions of the site is vital before rendering the program. And since my program is a study tool/educational site, simplicity in both aesthetic and function is critical. And my website's primary design would intersect at Interactivity and Changing Perspectives. Changing Perspectives is defined as when the design presents a framing or point of view that is new, coherent, and interesting enough to help the user perceive the particulars of a domain according to a new schema, which is what I hope to achieve through a simplistic, interactive design with a pleasant tone.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>I, Jill Marney, have developed this website specifically to tell any up-and-coming Liberal Arts students at Virginia Tech how rewarding it is to learn how to code, and create an aid specifically for HTML practice and resources. This will directly promote the VT-Shaped Model, which is a concept that has been in development at Virginia Tech to prepare their students to solve global problems in a technolgically advanced future through collaboration and contextual understanding. The model for the VT-Shaped Individual is an evolved form of the popular T-shaped student, who would have a deep knowledge of a discipline or way of thinking, typically directed towards their major. Leaders in higher education and other organizations have always encouraged the development of T-shaped students, but Virginia Techâ€™s VT-Shaped model enhances the T while coupling it with the V. The enhanced T is the area that I will be focusing on, since it emphasizes cross-cutting technology with all areas of curricula. This enhancement allows the majority of students to graduate with 21st century technology expertise, but the confusion that comes with a new field of knowledge can be demoralizing, which is what I and hoping to help.  
<p>As a freshman myself, I feel as though it is important to share the new model for Virginia Tech's Liberal Arts program with any rising first-years entering this field of study. I only taught myself the bare minimum of computer applications to skate by. I managed well in Microsoft Programs and Google Docs, but any deeper terrified me. Besides, I was more of a creative learner, drawn to reading, writing, and drawing; there didn't seem to be any point trying to learn the confusing and detailed art of coding. I did not realize how much I could thrive creatively with even just a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Coding is inherently intuitive and easy to commit to memory. To those who aren't initiually passionate about technological expertise, or to those who aren't detail-oriented, it will be a frustrating and draining process at the start. That's why the goal of this website will be to create a concise aid of all the information these sites share. I want to create a practice platform and a simple explanation of HTML, CSS, and Markdown for students who wish to start coding who aren't naturally drawn to the area of study. </p>
<h2>Application</h2>
    <p>What I have here is what would be the starting page, the introduction that would explain and advertise the VT-Shaped model, and offer links to sites that could help with the process. Ideally, I would create multiple pages, broken up based on topics (HTML, GitHub, etc.) It would have quick explanations of how to use each tool for coding, and then a cheat sheet for the shorthand. The hardest thing for me to code, but ultimately the most useful, would then be the related practice platforms that would be linked to their respective page of information. This is to reenforce the knowledge for the students. And, again, an organic and somewhat humorous tone to the website would help personalize the experience, and the simple, colorful design will attract and engage the viewers of the page. I believe this simple yet enriching site is needed, especially one that is specifically based around the VT-Shaped Model.</p>
